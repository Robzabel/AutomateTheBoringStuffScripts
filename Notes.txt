#In Second_Program, the if statement is differernt as it does not have any paramaters passed to evaluate the information on. This is becasue the input() function is called and the information is stored in the variable "name". The input function takes information in the form of strings, not boolean valuse so to evalute whether it is true or false, Python has Truthey and Falsey values. in strings the blank string evalustes to falsey all other non blank strings evaluate to Truthey. For numbers, the value 0 or 0.0 is Falsey and all other values evaluate to Truthey. You can use the bool() function to return a boolean value of the peramaters passed to it. so bool(0) is False whereas bool(42) is True.

#While loops in Third_program.py show the break statements, you can use a break statement if you have an infinate while loop such as (while True:).
You can also have the continue statement which jumps the loop back to the sart. in the program, once spam gets to 3 the if confition is true so it goes through to the continue command which misses the print statement and jumps back to the start of the program.

#For loops in the Fourth_Program.py show the range function. you can type range(10) into the interactive shell and it will come back with range(0,10) becaue it shows a  valuse called a range object which is ofthe range data type. just remember that the max number you put is how high it will go up but not include so rangea(10) will print 1-9. the third int that you can pass to the range function is called the step value which gives the ammount to incrememnt by
